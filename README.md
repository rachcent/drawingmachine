Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense (for example, hearing) is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, color or flavor.

I've always had a fascination of going to concerts and shows. The synchronization of the visuals and music, almost being meditative. Seeing the visuals, seeing the music based on the lazers, lighting, flashing colors, etc.
